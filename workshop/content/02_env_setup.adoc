# Environment Install and Setup

The environment install and setup will be performed with the help of the Red Hat AI Accelerator repository. This repo is intended to provide a core set of OpenShift features that would commonly be used for a Data Science environment, but can also be highly customized for specific scenarios.

Follow the following steps to complete the install and setup:

* Provision the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster from demo.redhat.com

* After the cluster is running and ready, log in as the admin

* Copy the login token as shown in the image. Paste it in the terminal and run it. This should log you into the cluster through the terminal.

* Navigate to the cloned folder with the command:
[source,terminal]
----
cd ai-accelerator/
----

* Run the bootstrap script by running the bootstrap.sh script
