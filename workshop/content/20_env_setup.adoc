# Environment Install and Setup

The environment install and setup will be performed with the help of the Red Hat AI Accelerator repository. This repo is intended to provide a core set of OpenShift features that would commonly be used for a Data Science environment, but can also be highly customized for specific scenarios.

Follow the following steps to complete the install and setup:

* We will work with the first provisioned cluster which will act like a demo cluster

* After the cluster is running and ready, log in as the admin

* Copy the login token as shown in the image. Paste it in the terminal and run it. This should log you into the cluster through the terminal.

* Log into your git account and fork the following repository
----
https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine.
[source,terminal]
----
git clone https://github.com/{Git_ID}/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Navigate to the cloned folder with the command:
[source,terminal]
----
cd ai-accelerator/
----

* Run the bootstrap script by running the bootstrap.sh script
[source,terminal]
----
./bootstrap.sh
----

* This will first install the GitOps Operator and then provide the user with the following overlays:

.Please enter a number to select a bootstrap folder:
[order=arabic]
1. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-eus-2.8-aws-gpu/
2. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-eus-2.8/
3. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast-aws-gpu/
4. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast/

* For _**Dev**_ and _**Prod**_ environments type the number 4 and press Enter. 

* For _**Demo**_ environments type the number 3 and press Enter. 

This will install all the applications in the bootstrap script and also provide a openshift-gitops-server (ArgoCD) link to check the status

* Log into the Argo CD link with the Openshift credentials and wait till everything Syncs correctly
