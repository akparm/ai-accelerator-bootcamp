== Welcome to the Red Hat OpenShift Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Bootcamp

For this bootcamp, provision 3 instances of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster from demo.redhat.com.

These would be used as demo, dev and prod clusters in this bootcamp.

## Spin up Demo Cluster
Navigate to https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=aws&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.sandbox-ocp.prod and order a _**AWS with OpenShift Open Environment**_.

The Control Plane Instance Type should be set to _**m6a.4xlarge**_
Please make sure this is set correctly or your cluster will not have enough resources

This will take around 1-1:20 hrs.

Once it's up and running, move onto the Environment Setup page.

When prompted with which overlay to install, choose: `3. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast-aws-gpu/`

This will take around 25-30 minutes for everything to spin up.

This will install RHOAI and related operators. Since we are using GPUs for the demo instance, it will also install the Nvidia GPU Operator and the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator.

This GPU overlay also uses _**MachineAutoscalers**_. Since there are Inferencing Service examples that use GPUs, a _**5.2xlarge**_ machineset (with GPU) will spin up. This can take a few minutes.

Note: If the granite inference service fails to spin up, delete the deployment and Argo should redeploy it.

## Spin up Dev and Prod Cluster

Navigate to https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=Red+Hat+OpenShift+Container+Platform+Cluster&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fopenshift-cnv.ocpmulti-wksp-cnv.prod and order 2 _**Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster**_. One for the _**Dev**_ environment and one for the _**Prod**_ environment.

We'll be using the DEV and PROD clusters for the gitops sections.
