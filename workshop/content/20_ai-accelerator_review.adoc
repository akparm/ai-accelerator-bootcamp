# ai-accelerator Project

Navigate to the ai-accelerator github project: https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator

1. Read the README
2. Navigate and read the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/blob/main/documentation/overview.md[Project Overview documentation]
3. Navigate and read the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/blob/main/documentation/installation.md[Installation documentation]

4. Navigate and read the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/tree/main/tenants[tenants documentation]

5. The ai-accelerator project installs Open Shift GitOps (ArgoCD) first, then uses ArgoCD to install RHOAI and the related operators. It also deploys examples such as serving examples, a workbench, and pipelines.

* The list of operators it can install are in the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/tree/main/components/operators[operators] folder.
*  Examples of model serving, workbench, and pipelines can be found in the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/tree/main/tenants[tenants] folder.

## Overlays

This project is set up with ArgoCD and Kustomize in mind. Meaning ArgoCD will handle the deployment of resources based on what Kustomize tells it.

1. When running the _**bootstrap.sh**_ script, it will apply the Open Shift GitOps operator by using Kustomize on the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/blob/b90f025691e14d8e8a8d5ff3452107f8a0c8f48d/scripts/bootstrap.sh#L11[GitOps_Overlay] https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/tree/b90f025691e14d8e8a8d5ff3452107f8a0c8f48d/components/operators/openshift-gitops/operator/overlays/latest[folder]

2. After GitOps installs, it will then run a https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator/blob/b90f025691e14d8e8a8d5ff3452107f8a0c8f48d/scripts/bootstrap.sh#L80[`kustomize build`] on the `bootstrap/overlays/*` folder. Which ever overlay you select in the bootstrap folder, it will apply RHOAI as well as the `clusters` folder. In this isntance, we choose the `rhoai-fast` overlay.

Looking at the picture:
1. Starting at `bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast` (this is the one we chose in the menu when running the _bootstrap.sh_ script)
